    Lionel Messi
        
Messi excelled in football since childhood. Because of his short height, he could easily sneak his way to the goal post. But had trouble scoring because of severe growth hormone deficiency. His family couldn’t afford to treat him. When Barcelona discovered Messi, his father gave them an ultimatum stating that he will only let his son play if they fund his treatment. Barcelona agreed and Messi emerged as one of the top goal scorers in the world.
